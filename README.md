This is a example registration flow I programmed that would be used in a social media mobile application.

In order to access the layout files click the files in the following order.

app/src/main/res/layouts

The layouts are ordered and with numbers on their top left corners.

Additionally, I have attached the screenshots of the three different layout screen to this repository and labeled them as: Screen 1, Screen 2, Screen 3.
